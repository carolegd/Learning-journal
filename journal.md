I was trained as a software developer but I haven’t produced code professionally since 2018. It’s been a long time!
Before that I had dabbled in a few languages : Pascal at university (Yes I am a dinosaur), then C, then Java, Javascript, Python, with a bit of Go, Ruby and PHP. 

Java and Javascript were the main languages I have worked in as a full-stack developper. Previously I had made a website for a small company using WordPress, which is how I got into PHP. 
When I was not working as a developer, I was interested in literature, translating from English to French, and biology. 

After having read the advice of someone working in bioinformatics, I have decided to document how I am learning how to program… again. 

In many ways it feels like I have to learn from scratch but on the other hand I risk getting bored if I take beginner classes. This is why I might try Udemy instead of Coursera. I still don’t know exactly what I’ll do and how it will work out. 

I plan on doing a blog at some point, but I am not there yet. I’ll start by getting acquainted to Git AGAIN - after that it’ll become a journal on GItHub. 

Right now I am using my MacBookAir’s built-in Notes App. I’ll move to a text editor later. MarkDown will work.

The Goal today is coming back to GIT. It should not be that difficult but it seems like I forgot everything. In the Python course I followed in 2020 Git wasn’t in the syllabus, so the last time I used it was before that. It’s been a long time. I remember the processes behind GIt and I think I know how it works but I don’t even remember commands like « git init ». A cheat sheet might be useful but right now I am beginning with the [w3c tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp). 
Also, I am going to use markdown with the text and Sublime text as an editor.

Fun fact : I have also forgotten Vi : not that I mastered Vi before, but at least I knew the basics.
This cheatsheet was useful : [Vi cheatsheet by universiry](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~mems/ece215/reference/vi-cheatsheet.pdf)

##GIT Commands 
git --version
git config --global user.name "name"
git config --global user.email "email@domain.com"

git init
git status 
git add
git add --all 
git commit -m "message"
git command -help
git help --all
git branch file
git branch
git checkout 
git merge 
git branch -d
